Online Game Store Analytics

Online store "Ice" selling video games from around the world. Data regarding user and expert reviews of games, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data is available from open sources. It is necessary to identify the patterns that determine whether a game can be said to be successful or not. That way, you can find the games with the most potential and plan their ad campaigns.
Data from 2016 is available, which is useful for planning the 2017 campaign.

This project will analyze user behavior and determine which game platforms are the most popular, as well as carry out the following two hypothetical objectives:

1. The average user rating of the XOne One and PC platforms is the same.
2. The average user rating for the Action and Sports genres is different.

To achieve the objectives of the hypothesis above, the following steps are carried out:
1. Read Data and General Information
2. Preparing and Correcting Data
3. Analyzing Data
4. Profiling of users for each region
5. Test the hypothesis
